# Rails Lite

## Objective

The purpose of this project was to implement a simple but functional version of the Rails API by hand. This project offered a greater insight into the inner workings of Rails and was once again a great opportunity to practice meta-programming concepts. Features from Rails that were implemented are as follows:

* Controllers
* Render method
* Session
* Router
* Flash
* Exceptions and error handling
* Static assets
* CSRF protection
